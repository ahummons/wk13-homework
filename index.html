        3D printing is an educational technology that is valuable across multiple disciplines. The Rebecca Crown Library staff is here to assist faculty with incorporating 3D printing into their courses.  A librarian can work with you to create an assignment or simply provide you students with an instruction session in the 3D lab.

        You can speak with a library liaison for your department who can help you work with the instructional design team for a Design Consultation. As a team we can work together to create a project that meets the learning objectives of your course. 3D printing is an exciting way to incorporate emerging technology into you class.
